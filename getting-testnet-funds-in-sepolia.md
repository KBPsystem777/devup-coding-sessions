# ➡️ Getting TestNet Funds in Sepolia

## What is Sepolia?

Sepolia is one of Ethereum's test networks, designed for developers to test smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) in a safe environment. It operates similarly to the Ethereum mainnet but uses test ETH, which has no real-world value.

### Steps to Get Testnet Funds in ETH Sepolia

1. **Network Dropdown:** Click on the network dropdown at the top of the MetaMask interface.
2. **Select Sepolia Testnet:** You should now see the "Sepolia Test Network" listed in the dropdown. Select it to switch your network to Sepolia.
