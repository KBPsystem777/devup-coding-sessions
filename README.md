# DevUp! Coding Session Prerequisites

## Technical Requirements

**Hardware**

* Computer: A laptop / desktop with at least 8GB of RAM
* Operating System: Windows / macOS / Linux, etc

**Software**

* **NodeJS**: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
  * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js is essential for developing blockchain applications as it provides the environment for running development frameworks like Hardhat.
* **Github**: [https://github.com](https://nodejs.org)
  * GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing you to store, manage, and track changes to your code repositories. It is widely used for open-source projects and provides a variety of tools for code review, project management, and integration with other development tools.
* **Hardhat**: [https://hardhat.org](https://hardhat.org)
  * Hardhat is a development environment designed specifically for Ethereum. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts. Hardhat makes it easier to manage complex Ethereum development workflows by offering features such as Solidity debugging, network forking, and task automation.
* **VSCode**: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  * Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is highly extensible and supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. For Solidity development, VSCode offers numerous extensions that provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging capabilities, making it an ideal choice for smart contract development.
