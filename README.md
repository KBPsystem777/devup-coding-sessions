# ðŸ’» DevUp! Coding Session Prerequisites

> ðŸ’¡**Important Note:** Attending this session requires prior experience in **JavaScript**. If you are taking up the coding session for **Arbitrum Stylus**, you should also have experience in either **C**, **C++** and **Rust** programming language

## Technical Requirements

### **Hardware**

* **Computer**: A laptop / desktop with at least 8GB of RAM
* **Operating System**: Windows / macOS / Linux, etc

### **ðŸ›œ WiFi Connectivity**

* Students are required to have a stable internet connection with a minimum speed of **5-10 Mbps** to participate effectively in this session.

### **Software**

* **Remix IDE**: [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
  * is an open-source, web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for developing smart contracts using the Solidity programming language on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers a suite of features that simplify the process of writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
* **Github**: [https://github.com](https://nodejs.org)
  * GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing you to store, manage, and track changes to your code repositories. It is widely used for open-source projects and provides a variety of tools for code review, project management, and integration with other development tools.
* **Metamask**: [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
  * MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain apps. It allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain directly from your web browser, making it easier to manage your crypto assets, interact with decentralized applications (dApps), and deploy smart contracts. MetaMask is essential for testing and deploying smart contracts on various Ethereum networks.
* **Test Ethereum**
  * It is essential for participants to have test ETH on the Sepolia test network. Test ETH is a form of Ethereum currency used on test networks to simulate transactions without using real money. This test ETH allows them to deploy and interact with their smart contracts in a risk-free environment, making it an indispensable part of the development process. Participants will receive test ETH by providing their wallet addresses here on our designated spreadsheet - [DevUp!
